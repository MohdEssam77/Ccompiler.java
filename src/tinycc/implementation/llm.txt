I did the first part of the project only (task 1 AST).
I used Chat GPT while studying the compiler chapter from the book. In the same chat, i attached the project description
and wrote the following prompt.

Based on the the chapter compiler that you explained me and the project description attached, explain me task 1 AST.
Explain the task and what am expected to build (don't impplement anything).

Then after getting the response and reading and understanding the task, I started the implementation of the classes.
I implemented most of them my own. When even some error occurs then I use Chat GPT again to see what causes it and how to fix it.

As I saw that the question was easy as we are just overriding toString() but it needed a lot of typing so I gave the classes I implemented and asked Chat GPT
to help me implementing other nodes of the AST. I also got Chat GPT help in implementing ASTFactory interface.

I am currently doing the first task in this project (attached is the project description). I am in the beginning, doing the *3 Abstract syntax tree and output* task which is the first task of the project. I want you to help in this task. Read the project description carefully and tell me how can I approach this task. Write pseudocode if possible. 
If you need me to provide you classes already there in the code given, let me know.
then follow up questions for example when I failed some tests when i first pushed the project and it helps in finding and fixing the error.
Didn't use any coding assistants. I mentioned comments in some of the files/classes that I used Chat GPT there.

I just did the first part of the project. Tried to do second part but saw that it needs a lot of time.
